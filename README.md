A Sample swift app to pull latest messages.  This sample uses the API's to access the list of emails and then retrieve email content.  This sample is not intended to be a full email client.  This is an example of how a company could use the API's to integrate mail functionality into their own app where WISPr could be used for Support or messaging capability.

To use this sample, you must have an account and access to the WISPr API's.  Signup for an account and access at (https://email.wispr.rocks/#/signup).
